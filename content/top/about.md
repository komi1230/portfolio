My name is Yusuke Kominami.

I'm 23 years old and living in Tokyo.
And I work at SoftBank as a machine learning engineer and at Aiful as a technical adviser.

I graduated from the faculty of Science in Kyoto University, majored Biology at Takada Lab.

About software engineering, I love Rust. It is a perfect programming language, I think.
My expertise ranges from HTML/CSS/JavaScript to Low-level programming. Furthermore, I have solid knowledge on machine learning and data science based on mathematics.

Outside of computer, I love watching documentary movies and working out.

From June 2017 to July 2018, I worked at Hitachi and made research on machine learning (especially, deep reinforcement learning).
And I have an experience of writing a book which has explained theoretically reinforcement learning with more than 100 pages.
You can read my book in below link (But this is written in Japanese).

My hobby is to make programs and commit OSS.
This is a plotter library for Common Lisp, I launched as OSS.
