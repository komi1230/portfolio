My name is Yusuke Kominami.

I'm 23 years old and living in Tokyo.
And I work at SoftBank as a machine learning engineer and at Aiful as a technical adviser.

I graduated from the faculty of Science in Kyoto University, majored Biology at [Takada Lab](http://theory.biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).

About software engineering, I love Rust. It is a perfect programming language, I think.
My expertise ranges from HTML/CSS/JavaScript to Low-level programming. Furthermore, I have solid knowledge on machine learning and data science based on mathematics.
And also I am a massive OSS enthusiasist.

Outside of computer, I love watching documentary movies and working out.
