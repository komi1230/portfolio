I&amp;rsquo;m 23 years old and living in Tokyo. And I work at SoftBank as a machine learning engineer and at Aiful as a technical adviser.
I graduated from the faculty of Science in Kyoto University, majored Biology at Takada Lab.
About software engineering, I love Rust. It is a perfect programming language, I think. My expertise ranges from HTML/CSS/JavaScript to Low-level programming. Furthermore, I have solid knowledge on machine learning and data science based on mathematics.</description></item></channel></rss>
