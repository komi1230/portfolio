[{"body":"Process input data in front end Material-UI is reallly convenient package for non-designer because programmer can easily make awesome design. And Material-UI has a variety of components, which are easy-to-custommize.\n To get data from user\u0026rsquo;s input, in normal HTML, we use \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; tag. But we have to store data into some variable to process data with JavaScript.\nIn practice You can easily make simple page with Textfield.\nimport React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import TextField from \u0026#39;@material-ui/core/TextField\u0026#39;; export default function OurForm() { return ( \u0026lt;TextField label=\u0026#34;Label\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; ); } And UI is like this.\n With this, We can accept user input. But we cannnot process data, for example console.log(data).\nOK, we will do it. All we have to do is use useState.\nimport React from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; import TextField from \u0026#39;@material-ui/core/TextField\u0026#39;; export default function OurForm() { const [data, setData] = React.useState(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); const handleSetData = (event) =\u0026gt; { setData(event.target.value); } return ( \u0026lt;TextField label=\u0026#34;Label\u0026#34; value={data} onChange={handlleSetData} /\u0026gt; ); } In pure React, it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to manage components\u0026rsquo; states.

This is not a joke. Modern software engineering requires variables to be scoped, and at the same time, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be changed even in scopes such as closures.\nHowever, we can\u0026rsquo;t sometimes avoid using global variable (Somtimes codes can be cleaner.) For such situations, Rust provides some syntax to controll global variables.\nThey are const and static.\nTo explain their functionality, let\u0026rsquo;s take a easy example.\nconstX: usize =0;fn main(){println!(\u0026#34;X = {}\u0026#34;,X);X+=1;println!(\u0026#34;X = {}\u0026#34;,X);}When you try to compile this, you will face an error message.\nerror[E0067]: invalidleft-handsideofassignment--\u0026gt; src/main.rs:5:5|5|X+=1;|-^^|||cannotassigntothisexpressionconst variable can\u0026rsquo;t be changed and can be accessed from any place.\nOn the other hand, this is compilable.\nconstX: usize =0;fn main(){unsafe{println!(\u0026#34;X = {}\u0026#34;,X);X+=1;println!(\u0026#34;X = {}\u0026#34;,X);}}This uses unsafe but static allows us to change itself.\nOK, the next example is more clear.\nusestd::sync::atomic::{self,AtomicUsize};constX: AtomicUsize=AtomicUsize::new(0);staticY: AtomicUsize=AtomicUsize::new(0);fn main(){for_in0..5{println!(\u0026#34;X = {}\u0026#34;,X.fetch_add(1,atomic::Ordering::SeqCst));}for_in0..5{println!(\u0026#34;Y = {}\u0026#34;,Y.fetch_add(1,atomic::Ordering::SeqCst));}}This code is from here. When you run, this prints below.\nX = 0 X = 0 X = 0 X = 0 X = 0 Y = 0 Y = 1 Y = 2 Y = 3 Y = 4 fetch_add takes \u0026amp;self, so \u0026amp;X and \u0026amp;Y are calculated in this example. About const, some anonymous local variable is allocated for each time, so the const variable looks unchanged. In short, new variable initialized as AtomicUsize is generated for each iteration.\nBut static fixes the address of the variable. So this is incremented for each iteration., which has 'static lifetime.\nTo summarize, the difference between const and static is:\n const defines the value determined in compiling. This fixes value, not address. static defines the address, which will be set value in compiling. It isn\u0026rsquo;t essential whether this is initialzied with value.  How to use properly const is really simple and easy to use. But static is a little diffucult to understand and use. In fact, static has cause to really step in it.\nWhen you set global variable initialized with static mut, this often results in undefined behaviour. For example, see this link.\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]struct Node{children: Vec\u0026lt;usize\u0026gt;,last: usize,}implNode{fn add(\u0026amp;mutself,next: usize)-\u0026gt; usize {self.children.push(next);self.last=next;next}}staticmutNODES: Vec\u0026lt;Node\u0026gt;=Vec::new();unsafefn new_node()-\u0026gt; usize {letret=NODES.len();NODES.push(Node{children: Vec::new(),last: 0});ret}fn main(){unsafe{letmutlast=new_node();for_in0..30{last=NODES[last].add(new_node());}fornodein\u0026amp;NODES{println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;,node.last);}}}In this code, NODES should be set as 0 -\u0026gt; 1 -\u0026gt; 2 -\u0026gt; \u0026hellip; -\u0026gt; 30. But the result is below.\n123056709101112131415017181920212223242526272829300The reason for such a phenomenon is static mut has global pointer.\nTo avoid this, you should avoid using global variable. Or use thread_local! macro.\nGlobal poiter can be dangerous, so it\u0026rsquo;s safer to restrict scope of global variable.\nthread_local! and lazy_static! thread_local! macro thread_local! is really useful to handle safely global variable. This macro allocates static data like raw static but this allocates for each thread (not global).\nusestd::cell::RefCell;thread_local!{staticX: RefCell\u0026lt;usize\u0026gt;=RefCell::new(0);}fn main(){X.with(|a|{*a.borrow_mut()+=1;})}To use it, you have to borrow with with method and make closure.\nYou can use static data safely without undefined behaviour.\nlazy_static! macro If you want to initialize global variable with some data (ex. File I/O), this is useful. There are some situations where you want to read some configuration files or dictionary data in advance and put the contents of those files globally.\nIn Rust, it is possible to create global variables by using static, but it is not usable in the above situation because the expression used for initialization must be evaluated at compile time.\n#[macro_use]externcratelazy_static;usestd::sync::Mutex;lazy_static::lazy_static!{staticrefX: Mutex\u0026lt;usize\u0026gt;=Mutex::new(0);}fn main(){*X.lock().unwrap()+=1;}","categories":["Tech"],"date":1599868800,"description":"Rust provides some syntax to allocate data to be able to be accessed globally.

It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.\n To tell simply, WebAssembly is fast language running on browsers. And people say WebAssembly as WASM in an shortened name.\nIn developing some application running in browsers, you have to write JavaScript to express complicated logic and provide rich UI in client side. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s OK if you want to just make application. But sometimes JavaScript can be a bottleneck in application\u0026rsquo;s performance. For this, there are two reasons:\n Big binary size: JavaScript has big runtime Slow: To compile JavaScrit takes high cost  JavaScript can express complicated logic and rich UI, but can be problem today\u0026rsquo;s modern Web application. For example, 3D game, AR/VR and computer vision takes high cost to work. Because of this, modern browser expects faster system.\nHere, it\u0026rsquo;s WebAssembly to solve this problem.\nFor more information about WebAssembly, see MDN.\nTools You have already grasped what WebAssembly is. In the next stage, let\u0026rsquo;s understand what tool there are in developing WebAssembly.\nAs a result, you can develop WebAssembly with C/C++, Go, Rust or etc. You have many choice, but here I recommend Rust.\nIf you use C/C++, you have to use emscripten to compile your code into WebAssembly. emscripten is used to import JavaScript from C/C++ and also outputs JavaScript from LLVMIR. But emscripten cannot optimise codes and the ecosystem in developing is a little weak.\nIf you use Go, you can make WebAssembly code just by setting compile target. But Go has garbage collection to manage computer memory, and the binary size can be larger (this kills WebAssembly\u0026rsquo;s merit)\nThen, your choice is only one: Rust.\nWhen developing WebAssembly in Rust, wasm-bindgen makes your developing experience more comfortable. wasm-bindgen is a tool to run Rust code in browsers, developed by Mozilla. And this offers newer and better ecosystem than emscripten.\nActually, emscripten is also able to compile Rust code to WebAssembly. Here I will compare wasm-bindgen with emscripten.\nemscripten emscripten is compiler of C/C++ into asm.js or WebAssembly via LLVMIR. But it\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to use if you use only this. As a helper tool for compiling with emscripten, there is Binaryen, which is kind of wrapper of emscripten.\nSo far, these are not only for Rust but for C/C++. To compile Rust code into WebAssembly, you have to use emscripten-sys, stdweb and cargo-web.\n emscripten-sys: A crate for bindings of runtime of emscripten from Rust. stdweb: A crate for bindings of DOM from Rust. cargo-web: A build tool like npm. This includes stdweb.  These tools for Rust seems no longer developed since last commit is 1 year ago.\nwasm-bindgen wasm-bindgen is a tool to run Rust in browser, developed by Mozilla. This tool is used to import Rust code from JavaScript.\nThere are some helper tools for this.\n wasm-bindgen: A crate including types. js-sys: A crate to run JavaScript code in Rust. web-sys: A crate to help Rust use DOM. wasm-bindgen-futures: A crate to interact between Future type of Rust and Promise type of JavaScript wasm-bindgen-cli: A build tool to add runtime of FFI of Rust and JavaScript to wasm file made with wasm-bindgen, js-sys and web-sys. wasm-pack: A build tool to compile Rust code into wasm file and make package of npm.  Start Project OK, let\u0026rsquo;s start WebAssembly project.\nFirst, install wasm-pack.\n$ cargo install wasm-pack Next, make project directory with wasm-pack.\n$ wasm-pack new {ProjectName} Then, your directory will be like this:\n. ├── Cargo.toml ├── LICENSE_APACHE ├── LICENSE_MIT ├── README.md ├── src │ ├── lib.rs │ └── utils.rs └── tests └── web.rs When starting WebAssembly project, you have to set crate-type = [\u0026quot;cdylib\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rlib\u0026quot;] in Cargo.toml to handle wasm file. And make sure there is wasm-bindgen as dependencies in Cargo.toml.\nIn src/lib.rs, there is some functions to run alert function in browser as default.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s build your project and say Hello World !\n$ wasm-pack build --target web This target flag means --target web turns on including ES modules.\nThen, you can find pkg/ directory has been made. In this directory, there are .wasm file and its helper or driber (for example, *.d.ts is type definition file)\nFinally, make pkg/index.html and write like this:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;hello-wasm example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;module\u0026#34;\u0026gt; import * as mod from \u0026#34;./{ProjectName}.js\u0026#34;; (async () =\u0026gt; { await mod.default(); mod.greet(); })(); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Here we want to import .wasm file, so we set type=\u0026quot;module\u0026quot; in script tag. (if just \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/script/, you cannot import files).\nNow, your directory structure is like this:\n. ├── Cargo.lock ├── Cargo.toml ├── LICENSE_APACHE ├── LICENSE_MIT ├── README.md ├── pkg │ ├── README.md │ ├── index.html │ ├── {ProjectName}.d.ts │ ├── {ProjectName}.js │ ├── {ProjectName}_bg.d.ts │ ├── {ProjectName}_bg.js │ ├── {ProjectName}_bg.wasm │ └── package.json ├── src │ ├── lib.rs │ └── utils.rs ├── tests │ └── web.rs └── target └── ... Finally, run any server (for example, miniserver or python -m http.server 8000) and check browser.\n You are already WebAssembly developer!\nOther approach Not convinced? Then, run wasm file with Deno!\nMake add.rs!\n#![no_main]#![no_std]#[panic_handler]fn panic(_info: \u0026amp;core::panic::PanicInfo)-\u0026gt; !{loop{}}#[no_mangle]pubfn add(a: i32,b: i32)-\u0026gt; i32 {a+b}: And compile it.\n$ rustc --target wasm32-unknown-unknown add.rs Then, make main.js.\nconst bin = Deno.readFileSync(\u0026#34;./add.wasm\u0026#34;); const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bin); const ex = wasm.instance.exports; const add = ex.add; console.log(add(1, 2)); Finally, run this.\n$ deno run -A main.js You can find this wasm file also works!\n","categories":["Tech"],"date":1599350400,"description":"There are many tools around WebAssembly, and they are a bit complicated.

I\u0026rsquo;m 23 years old and graguated from Kyoto University in this March. When I was student, I majored in Bioinformatics.\nWhy am I a software engineer?\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in Biology, more interested in computing. So when I was in university, I just stuck on programming.\nFor more about me, see my Twitter or LinkedIn.\nWhy to start Blog? Today, it\u0026rsquo;s more and more important to offer tech information. This is because to do this makes me well-known in software developers community and able to get more opportunity. In other aspects, modern computer system and Web programming are really complicated, and today there are many software engineers in the world. This means there may be software developers who are stuck in the same problem at the same time. But if someone developed some solution, others should see it to avoid wasting time.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I started tech blog.\nHow to build Blog OK, we are ready to start blog. Here we will use Hugo and GitHub Actions.\nHugo is a static site generator, written in Go. It\u0026rsquo;s blazingly fast and really stable. And also there is a big community and there are so many themes.\nGitHub Actions is a platform to build and deploy your blog. The way to use this is really easy: just make a new repository and set a .yaml file in the repository.\nSetup Hugo If you use macOS, you can get Hugo via Homebrew.\n$ brew install hugo For other OS, check this page.\nIf OK, type below command to make sure you have Hugo.\n$ hugo --version Can you see some version info in your terminal? Then, you are OK.\nNext, we will make Blog repository. Type below command.\n$ hugo new site {YourBlogName} In this {YourBlogName}, anything is OK. For example, hugo new site MyBlog. When done, you can see there is a directory named {YourBlogName} in your directory.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive into this directory. Here we have some directoies and a config file.\n. ├── archetypes │ └── default.md ├── config.toml ├── content ├── data ├── layouts ├── static └── themes Hugo enables us to use site theme. In this tutorial, we will use clean-white. This is like this: Actually I use this theme in my blog (but customed a little). I love this theme because this has many options and is really simple and cool.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s clone this repository into your local directory.\n$ git clone https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite.git themes/hugo-theme-cleanwhite Next, edit config.toml to reflect this theme. To do this, add theme = \u0026quot;hugo-theme-cleanwhite\u0026quot;\nThen, your config file is like this.\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;http://example.org/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;My New Hugo Site\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;hugo-theme-cleanwhite\u0026#34; OK, let\u0026rsquo;s build this site. Type below command.\n$ hugo server Good job! You already have your own site!\nDo you want to add some article? Just add some markdown file.\n$ hugo new post/hello-world.md Then you can see this new article in your site.\nFurthermore This theme has many options: sidebar, feature tags, SNS link, or more. If you want to turn on these options, see this config of examle site.\nAs a side note, this blog\u0026rsquo;s config is like this:\nbaseURL = \u0026#34;http://komi.dev\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Launch Today\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;hugo-theme-cleanwhite\u0026#34; preserveTaxonomyNames = true paginate = 5 hasCJKLanguage = true [outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RSS\u0026#34;] [params] custom_css = [\u0026#34;css/custom-font.css\u0026#34;] header_image = \u0026#34;img/home.jpg\u0026#34; SEOTitle = \u0026#34;Kominami Blog\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;Yusuke Kominami\u0026#39;s Blog.

OK, let\u0026rsquo;s do it.\nAt first, push your site to your repository.\n$ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m \u0026#34;initialized\u0026#34; $ git remote add origin https://github.com/{YourGitHubAccountID}/{RepositoryName} $ git push -u origin master Next, setup GitHub Actions. To do this, we have 2 ways.\n Add .yaml file locally and push it to your repository Add .yaml file in GitHub site  Difference between these is whether the interface in adding .yaml file is CUI or GUI. Here we will do it by CUI.\nMake directory named .github/workflows/ and .yaml file.\n$ mkdir -p .github/workflows $ touch .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml GitHub Actions runs with .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml, so this is needed.\nContent of this .yaml file should be like this:\nname:GitHubPages# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request# events but only for the master branchon:push:branches:- master# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in paralleljobs:deploy:# The type of runner that the job will run onruns-on:ubuntu-latest# Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the jobsteps:# Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it- uses:actions/checkout@v2with:submodules:true# Fetch Hugo themesfetch-depth:0- name:SetupHugouses:peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2with:hugo-version:\u0026#39;0.74.3\u0026#39;- name:Buildrun:hugo--minify- name:Deployuses:peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3with:github_token:${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}publish_dir:./publicHere I don\u0026rsquo;t explain this, but this config make GitHub Actions deploy your site.\nOK push this to your repository. Then, GitHub Actions is running or have run in your repository. There is a green check mark.\nSetting config in repository So far, almost all jobs are done. Finally, we will share your site with others.\nSee Settings page in your repository. In the middle of the page, you can see GitHub Pages group. This setting handles which directory to deploy.\nHere, set source branch to gh-pages and the directory to /(root).\nCongratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve done all jobs!\nCheck https://{YourGitHubAccoutID}.github.io/{RepositoryName}. Your site has been deployed.\nLinks  Hugo Hugo themes My site repository Sample config  ","categories":["Tech"],"date":1599264000,"description":"Inroduce myself and how to build this blog with Zola and GitHub Actions.","permalink":"http://komi.dev/post/2020-09-05-make-blog/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T00:00:00Z","section":"post","tags":["zsh","GitHub","GitHub Actions","GitHub Pages"],"title":"Hello My New Blog","url":"/post/2020-09-05-make-blog/"}]
